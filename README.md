# Magic 8 Ball Project for Javascript for Beginners

## Description

## This is a project that I made for my class based off the art style of the a game I played called OMORI. The light bulb switches the app to dark mode and has a little clicking sound, the enter button does a cat sound which most people would not expect and get scared at first lol. I do plan to work more on this project once I learn more of the animation part of Javascript.
